# Meditation-Yoga

Aim of the project is to create awareness among the people about the importance of meditation and yoga in everyone’s life.

Reason to make this Project or Choose this topic “MEDITATION AND YOGA “is that mental health of the people is deteriorating at an alarming rate due to which they are suffering from depression, anxiety and stress in their life. Anxiety and depression are the most common mental health disorders in students. Students with anxiety may have low attendance, struggle to finish their work, show declining academic performance, fear new experiences, or worry excessively about assignments, homework and grades. Meditation and Yoga are keys to good mental health.

I have made this Project using Python 3.11.0 and different Python Modules. I have made a MENU DRIVEN PROGRAM to
•	retrieve the information about meditation, yoga and mental health using text file. 
•	I made a quiz on meditation to test our knowledge using binary file.
•	I collected real statistics all over the world about meditation, yoga and mental health using csv file.
•	I included links for more information on different topics using webbrowser module.
